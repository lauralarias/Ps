        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-8">What are the side effects of TMS? This is a common question for individuals considering this form of treatment. While repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is safe and well-tolerated, as with any medical procedure, there are potential pros and cons of TMS.</p>
        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mb-10">
          {/* Dizziness */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-6 border-t-4 border-[#ff6f61]">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#2A5DCC] mb-2">Dizziness</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Patients may experience a sensation of dizziness during or shortly after TMS sessions. This occurs as the magnetic pulses stimulate the brain, occasionally affecting the inner ear's balance mechanisms. Typically, it is mild and subsides quickly, allowing patients to continue their daily activities without interruption.</p>
          </div>
          {/* Headaches */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-6 border-t-4 border-[#ff6f61]">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#2A5DCC] mb-2">Headaches</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">Some individuals report mild headaches following TMS sessions, likely due to the stimulation of superficial nerves and muscle contractions in the scalp. These are generally manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers and often decrease in frequency as treatment progresses.</p>
          </div>
          {/* Scalp Discomfort */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-6 border-t-4 border-[#ff6f61]">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#2A5DCC] mb-2">Scalp Discomfort</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">During TMS treatment, patients might feel slight discomfort or tingling at the site where the coil is placed. The sensation is usually brief and diminishes over subsequent sessions as the body acclimates to the procedure.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">The good news is that magnetic therapy side effects are temporary and usually resolve on their own. Serious repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS side effects are exceedingly rare, especially when conducted by trained professionals in a controlled environment.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">Also, because there are no TMS long-term side effects, many people are choosing this non-invasive, pain-free approach to mental health treatment. Because TMS side effects long-term have not been reported, it is a safe option for patients seeking sustainable relief from their symptoms.</p>
